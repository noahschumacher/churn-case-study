## User Churn Case Study

This case study examines user data of a ride share company and attempts to predict when a user is at risk of churning. The following describes the structure of this repository and outlines some of the findings. A power point presentation on this study can be found at: (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VioQ_eyWrkHiL3bYA5y07LH-I6__7uViXmE0HuHxGCM/edit?usp=sharing). The data is ommited from the repository as per request of the company.


### Structure:
- Initial EDA was done in eda.ipynb file.
- The bulk of the model including data cleaning is done in churn_model.py
- Some helper functions for generating profit curves in in helpers.py
- Images directory contains:
	- Profit curves with different budgets.
	- A feature importance plot.
	- An ROC plot of our model.

### Model:
- The final model used was a Gradient Boosted Model
- It performed slightly better than a Random Forrest and significantly better than a Logistic Regression model.
- A Grid Search was run to find the optimized parameters.
- Final Model had an AUC score of .845


#### Findings:
- Several different budgets were created assuming that one way to get an at-risk customer to not churn was a promotion. We created several different budgets with this assumption in order to figure out what the optimal threshold would be in considering a user at-risk.
- These findings are displayed in the images folder.
- Analyzing the feature importance in our Gradient Boosted model revealed the the strongest factors were:
	- The % of time the user rode during surge pricing.
	- The % of time the user used the service during the weekday.
